          <h3>Game Of Learners Season 1 Project - MediChap</h3>
          <div>
            MediChap was an online E-Hospital that we created during the first
            days of the pandemic, because we foresaw a problem with self
            medication. MediChap is a platform that can enable users to have
            hospital records stored from doctors of various institutions. The
            platform was a Software as a Service and was offered to all
            hospitals. It also had a pharmacy checkout system where the doctor
            could enter prescription medication and the app would show you which
            pharmacies in the region on the app sell the medication and whether
            they deliver.
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We used NodeJS, where we created an Express API that was consumed
              by EJS Templating Engine which had some cool JavaScript to make a
              Progressive Web Application.
